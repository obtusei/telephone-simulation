## Introduction

This project is a telephone simulation implemented in Java, created as part of the lab work for Nepal Engineering College.

## Project Overview

The telephone simulation aims to replicate the functionality of a basic telephone system, allowing users to make calls and end calls. The application provides a simple GUI to interact with the telephone functionalities.

## Features

- **Make a Call:** Users can dial a listed number and place a call to another user within the simulation.

- **Receive a Call:** Users can receive incoming calls and respond accordingly.

- **Call Duration**: Users are given an option to choose for the length of call. After the completion of that call, call will be ended automatically.

- **End Call:** Users have option to end their call.
- **Current Call History:** Current call history will be show in the table.

## Technologies Used

- Java
